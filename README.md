Task catalog POC

This repository is a POC (Proof of Concept) of the idea to have a catalog of common methods shared by multiple executors (clients) with two main features.

## Method versioning

One method may have multiple versions wich the executors can select on runtime.

## Method plugability

A method my also have one or more plugin points to add extra bits of custom behaviour

## Technology

The aim is to create a good POC without using any framework or library besides the Python standard library

This project is being developed with Python 3.8 in mind, but any version of python from 3.6 onwards should work fine.
